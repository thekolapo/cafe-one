# Cafe One

> The Frontend client sits in the `frontend` folder.

## Running the Node.js server locally

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start server in development
npm run start:dev

# start server (locally)
npm run start

# By default the server runs on port 3005

# To change this behavior create a .env file at the root of the project and specify the new PORT value.
```
